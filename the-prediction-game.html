By making predictions, testing them against outcomes, and refining your understanding, you can reduce distortion, build epistemic humility, and improve clarity across life’s domains.</p><p>This game is safe, inclusive, and designed for families, friend groups, or teams who want to grow together in wisdom, not just knowledge.</p><hr><h2 id="🌱-core-principles">🌱 Core Principles</h2><ul><li><strong>PF can’t be forced.</strong> But it <em>can</em> be invited through voluntary, thoughtful play.</li><li><strong>Predictions reveal perception.</strong> By comparing expectations to outcomes, we expose distortion or clarity.</li><li><strong>Growth happens through feedback.</strong> Scoring and review help participants calibrate, not compete.</li><li><strong>Humility is rewarded.</strong> Admitting wrong views earns points, not shame.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="👥-who-can-play">👥 Who Can Play?</h2><ul><li>Families</li><li>Study groups</li><li>Friends or youth groups</li><li>Leadership or ministry teams</li></ul><p>All that’s required is trust, curiosity, and a shared desire to grow in clarity.</p><hr><h2 id="🧩-how-to-play">🧩 How to Play</h2><h3 id="1-set-a-timeframe">1. Set a Timeframe</h3><ul><li>Daily, weekly, or monthly rounds; choose your pace</li></ul><h3 id="2-make-predictions">2. Make Predictions</h3><p>Each player writes down 1–3 thoughtful, testable predictions for the upcoming round. The goal is not to guess, but to reveal and test how clearly you see.</p><p>Use the Prediction Form below to structure your entry.</p><h4 id="📝-prediction-form">📝 Prediction Form</h4><p>Use this form to submit thoughtful, clarity-building predictions during each round of the Prediction Game.</p><h5 id="🔮-prediction">🔮 Prediction:</h5><p><em>What do you think will happen?</em><br>Be specific and avoid vague, trivial, or guaranteed outcomes.</p><blockquote><p>Example: “I predict that Henry will push back against the new policy in tomorrow’s meeting.”</p></blockquote><h5 id="⏳-timeframe-deadline">⏳ Timeframe (Deadline):</h5><p><em>When will we know if you were right?</em><br>Tie it to a date, event, or specific window.</p><blockquote><p>Example: “By end of the meeting on Tuesday,” or “Before Sunday at 10pm.”</p></blockquote><h5 id="🎯-reasoning-why-do-you-think-this">🎯 Reasoning (Why do you think this?):</h5><p><em>What insight, pattern, or judgment led you to this prediction?</em><br>Avoid simply repeating external data (like weather forecasts or headlines) unless you’re adding original interpretation.</p><blockquote><p>Good: “The weather app shows sunshine, but I noticed thick cloud movement this morning.”<br>Good: “This person tends to reject rules that challenge their autonomy.”</p></blockquote><h5 id="📉-what-would-prove-this-wrong">📉 What Would Prove This Wrong?</h5><p><em>What outcome would clearly falsify your prediction?</em><br>This helps test the clarity and sharpness of your lens.</p><blockquote><p>Example: “If Henry supports the policy or doesn’t respond at all, I’ll consider this prediction wrong.”</p></blockquote><h5 id="📊-confidence-level-010">📊 Confidence Level (0–10):</h5><p><em>How sure are you, really?</em><br>Be honest.

The goal is not to win, but to grow together in clarity.</p><h3 id="👤-what-is-a-pf-mentor">👤 What Is a PF Mentor?</h3><p>A PF Mentor is a more experienced player who partners with a newer or struggling participant to:</p><ul><li>Encourage thoughtful predictions</li><li>Guide reasoning without controlling the outcome</li><li>Promote clarity over correctness</li><li>Normalize mistakes as part of growth</li></ul><blockquote><p>A PF Mentor helps the player polish their own lens, not replace it with someone else’s.</p></blockquote><h3 id="🛠️-how-it-works">🛠️ How It Works</h3><h4 id="1-pairing-up">1.

Without a deadline, you can’t determine when to evaluate it, or even if it came true at all.</p><p>Vague predictions like “I will get in shape” or “He’ll regret that decision someday” stretch into the future with no endpoint.
