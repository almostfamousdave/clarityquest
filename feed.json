Name the Trigger</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What emotion just spiked in me?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Label it honestly: anger, embarrassment, fear, jealousy, sadness, shame.</p><p>This defuses its control.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"2-delay-reaction\">2. Delay Reaction</h3>\n<p>When PF drops, don’t respond.<br>Wait. Breathe. Step back.</p><blockquote>\n<p><em>“Is this emotion a signal… or is it a smokescreen?”</em></p></blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"3-journal-the-emotion\">3. Journal the Emotion</h3>\n<p>Use a <strong>Truth Journal</strong> method:</p><p>Emotion: [e.g., anger]\nTrigger: [e.g., someone questioned me]\nInterpretation: [e.g., they think I’m stupid]\nPossible distortion: [e.g., maybe I feel insecure, not attacked]\nWhat’s actually true? [e.g., they were asking for clarity]</p><p>Over time, this process lowers emotional interference and raises PF.</p><hr>\n<h3 id=\"4-find-the-pattern\">4. Find the Pattern</h3>\n<p>Ask:</p><ul>\n<li>Do I react this way often?</li>\n<li>Is there a past wound beneath this?</li>\n<li>What truth am I avoiding because of this emotion?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emotional fog often protects a <em>painful truth</em> you’re not ready to face, yet.</p></blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"5-revisit-with-a-clearer-lens\">5. Revisit With a Clearer Lens</h3>\n<p>Once the emotion has cooled, go back to the situation.<br>Ask:</p><ul>\n<li><em>What actually happened?</em>  </li>\n<li><em>What part did my emotion play?</em>  </li>\n<li><em>What would a higher PF response look like?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how you <em>reclaim clarity.</em></p><hr>\n<h2 id=\"🔚-bottom-line\">🔚 Bottom Line</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Emotions are signals, not maps.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>They tell you something is important, but they don’t define what’s true.</p><p>When you let emotion drive your perception, your PF drops.<br>But when you slow down, reflect, and journal the distortion, <strong>clarity returns.</strong></p><p>Truth and emotion don’t have to be enemies, but emotion must be <em>disciplined</em> to make room for clarity.</p><p>That’s the work.<br>That’s the way forward.</p>",
