Most people walk a line between just enough truth to function and just enough illusion to stay emotionally comfortable. This is what the framework calls <strong>Comfort Bias</strong>, a state where <em>truth is avoided</em> if it threatens the ego, identity, or group belonging.</p><hr>\n<h2 id=\"🧠-why-most-people-choose-comfort-over-clarity\">🧠 Why Most People Choose Comfort Over Clarity</h2>\n<p>According to the PF scale, the average person lives in the <strong>0.6 to 0.8 PF range</strong>; not delusional, but still shaped by culture, emotion, and noise. They’re not seeking deception, but they’re not actively pursuing uncomfortable truths either.</p><p>This balance creates what could be called the <strong>Optimal Delusion</strong>:<br>A perception of the world that is clear <em>enough</em> to survive and succeed, but not so clear that it disrupts emotional comfort or social harmony.</p><blockquote>\n<p>“People act on what they believe is real.
