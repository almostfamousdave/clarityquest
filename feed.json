            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>This case study follows a woman who was once emotionally reactive and ideologically rigid. She often assumed the worst in others, clung to one-sided narratives, and responded to disagreement with hostility. However, through a series of failures and hard truths, she began to shift. Over time, she traded certainty for curiosity, corrected her thinking, and eventually became a mentor to others seeking clarity. Her story shows that a high Perception Factor (PF) is not about being perfect, but about choosing truth, again and again.</p><hr>\n<h2 id=\"🧠-situation\">🧠 Situation</h2>\n<p>In her earlier years, she was fiery and passionate. She knew what she believed, and she defended it with force. Whether in politics, religion, or relationships, she saw things in black and white.

When confronted, she doubled down.

Each time, she walked away believing she had been wronged, until she reviewed her own words and actions with fresh eyes.</p><p>One night, while journaling, she wrote:</p><blockquote>\n<p>“What if I’m not the one being persecuted?

He avoided uncomfortable truths, sidestepped personal accountability, and filtered reality through a lens of selective ignorance.
