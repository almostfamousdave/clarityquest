He often pointed to his older brother, who attended UT Austin and later identified as homosexual, claiming college turned him into a ‚Äúliberal homosexual.‚Äù That experience appeared to define his attitude against higher education.</p><p>When his own son finished high school, the father offered no encouragement for college. Instead, he repeated the line:  </p><blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a degree. You hire people with degrees.‚Äù</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, decades later, the son reflects on the cost of that guidance. While successful in his own right, he often feels like he‚Äôs been playing catch-up, especially in business tools, technology, business law, and systems thinking.

Whenever she faced personal, relational, or ethical discomfort, she retreated into vague spiritual phrases and deferential optimism. While she appeared faithful and composed, her Perception Factor (PF) remained low due to a persistent avoidance of real-world clarity.</p><hr>\n<h2 id=\"üß†-situation\">üß† Situation</h2>\n<p>She was deeply committed to her faith. She prayed daily, quoted Scripture often, and was seen as a ‚Äúspiritually mature‚Äù member of her church community.</p><p>But when life presented hard questions about her marriage, money habits, strained friendships, or moral decisions her go-to response was:</p><blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúGod will work it out.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm just giving it to the Lord.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my place to judge.‚Äù</p></blockquote>\n<p>These words seemed wise on the surface.
