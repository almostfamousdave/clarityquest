He often pointed to his older brother, who attended UT Austin and later identified as homosexual, claiming college turned him into a ‚Äúliberal homosexual.‚Äù That experience appeared to define his attitude against higher education.</p><p>When his own son finished high school, the father offered no encouragement for college. Instead, he repeated the line:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a degree. You hire people with degrees.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>Now, decades later, the son reflects on the cost of that guidance. While successful in his own right, he often feels like he‚Äôs been playing catch-up, especially in business tools, technology, business law, and systems thinking. He saved to send his own son to college. That son is now a lawyer at a prestigious firm.</p><hr><h2 id="üîç-pf-analysis">üîç PF Analysis</h2><h3 id="1-noise-sources-opposite-side-of-pf-triangle">1.

You gave your son both the foundation and the <em>clarity</em> to rise.</p><p>That‚Äôs legacy.</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt rise in PF by being smarter.<br>You rise by refusing to lie to yourself, and learning to see through noise.‚Äù<br>‚Äî <em>Perception Factor Framework</em></p></blockquote></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 5, 2025</p><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-case-study/">PF Case Studies</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://clarityquest.info/authors/almostfamousdave/" class="invert" rel="author">AlmostFamousDave</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/what-is-pf.html" target="_self">What is Perception Factor (PF)?</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/perception-factor-framework.html" target="_self">Perception Factor Framework</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-foundations/" target="_self">PF Foundations</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-concepts/" target="_self">PF Concepts</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-tools/" target="_self">PF Tools</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-distortions/" target="_self">PF Distortions</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-growth/" target="_self">PF Growth</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-journaling/" target="_self">PF Journaling</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-analysis/" target="_self">PF Analysis</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/tags/pf-case-study/" target="_self">PF Case Studies</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/perception-factor-glossary.html" target="_self">PF Glossary</a></li><li><a href="https://clarityquest.info/about.html" target="_self">About</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p><a href="https://clarityquest.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clarity Quest</a> ¬© 2025 by David Kuykendall is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>¬†</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://clarityquest.info/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://clarityquest.info/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://clarityquest.info/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://clarityquest.info/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://clarityquest.info/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script><script>MathJax = {
